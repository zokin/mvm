 * @brief launch one or more compute work groups using parameters stored in a

 *
 * glDispatchComputeIndirect launches one or more compute work groups using
 * parameters stored in the buffer object currently bound to the
 * GL_DISPATCH_INDIRECT_BUFFER​ target. Each work group is processed by the
 * active program object for the compute shader stage. While the individual
 * shader invocations within a work group are executed as a unit, work groups
 * are executed completely independently and in unspecified order. indirect​
 * contains the offset into the data store of the buffer object bound to the
 * GL_DISPATCH_INDIRECT_BUFFER​ target at which the parameters are stored.
 *
 * The parameters addressed by indirect​ are packed a structure, which takes
 * the form (in C):
 *
 * typedef  struct {
 *     uint  num_groups_x;
 *     uint  num_groups_y;
 *     uint  num_groups_z;
 * } DispatchIndirectCommand;
 * A call to glDispatchComputeIndirect is equivalent, assuming no errors are
 * generated, to:
 *
 * cmd = (const DispatchIndirectCommand  *)indirect;
 * glDispatchComputeIndirect(cmd->num_groups_x, cmd->num_groups_y, cmd->num_groups_z);
 *
 * Unlike glDispatchCompute​, no error is generated if any of the num_groups_x​,
 * num_groups_y​ or num_groups_z​ members of the DispatchIndirectCommand​ is
 * larger than the value of GL_MAX_COMPUTE_WORK_GROUP_COUNT​ for the
 * corresponding dimension. In such circumstances, behavior is undefined and
 * may lead to application termination.
 *
 * @param indirect The offset into the buffer object currently bound to the
 *                 GL_DISPATCH_INDIRECT_BUFFER​ buffer target at which the
 *                 dispatch parameters are stored.
 * @see glDispatchComputeIndirect
