/**
 * @brief set front and back function and reference value for stencil testing
 *
 * Stenciling, like depth-buffering, enables and disables drawing on a
 * per-pixel basis. Stencil planes are first drawn into using GL drawing
 * primitives, then geometry and images are rendered using the stencil planes
 * to mask out portions of the screen. Stenciling is typically used in
 * multipass rendering algorithms to achieve special effects, such as decals,
 * outlining, and constructive solid geometry rendering.
 *
 * The stencil test conditionally eliminates a pixel based on the outcome of a
 * comparison between the reference value and the value in the stencil buffer.
 * To enable and disable the test, call Context::Enable​ and Context::Disable​
 * with argument Capability::StencilTest. To specify actions based on the
 * outcome of the stencil test, call glStencilOp​ or glStencilOpSeparate​.
 *
 * There can be two separate sets of func​, ref​, and mask​ parameters; one
 * affects back-facing polygons, and the other affects front-facing polygons
 * as well as other non-polygon primitives. glStencilFunc​ sets both front and
 * back stencil state to the same values. Use glStencilFuncSeparate​ to set
 * front and back stencil state to different values.
 *
 * func​ is a symbolic constant that determines the stencil comparison function.
 * It accepts one of eight values, shown in the following list. ref​ is an
 * integer reference value that is used in the stencil comparison. It is
 * clamped to the range [0, 2n - 1], where n is the number of bitplanes in the
 * stencil buffer. mask​ is bitwise ANDed with both the reference value and the
 * stored stencil value, with the ANDed values participating in the comparison.
 *
 * If stencil represents the value stored in the corresponding stencil buffer
 * location, the following list shows the effect of each comparison function
 * that can be specified by func​. Only if the comparison succeeds is the pixel
 * passed through to the next stage in the rasterization process
 * (see StencilOp​). All tests treat stencil values as unsigned integers in the
 * range [0, 2n - 1], where n is the number of bitplanes in the stencil buffer.
 *
 * The following values are accepted by func​:
 *
 * CompareFunc::Never​
 *   Always fails.
 * CompareFunc::Less
 *   Passes if ( ref​ & mask​ ) < ( stencil & mask​ ).
 * CompareFunc::LEqual​
 *   Passes if ( ref​ & mask​ ) <= ( stencil & mask​ ).
 * CompareFunc::Greater​
 *   Passes if ( ref​ & mask​ ) > ( stencil & mask​ ).
 * CompareFunc::GEqual
 *   Passes if ( ref​ & mask​ ) >= ( stencil & mask​ ).
 * CompareFunc::Equal
 *   Passes if ( ref​ & mask​ ) = ( stencil & mask​ ).
 * CompareFunc::NotEqual​
 *   Passes if ( ref​ & mask​ ) != ( stencil & mask​ ).
 * CompareFunc::Always
 *   Always passes.
 *
 * @param func Specifies the test function.
 * @param ref  Specifies the reference value for the stencil test. ref​ is
 *             clamped to the range [0, 2n - 1], where n is the number of
 *             bitplanes in the stencil buffer. The initial value is 0.
 * @param mask Specifies a mask that is ANDed with both the reference value
 *             and the stored stencil value when the test is done. The initial
 *             value is all 1's.

 *
 * glStencilOp takes three arguments that indicate what happens to the stored
